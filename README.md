# Tower Unite Instrument Player
# This is a development branch, it might not be tested, might be buggy, might have unfinished features or might not compile. Use at your own risk!

This program will play the pasted song in Tower Unite.

You are free to download, modify and redistribute modified versions of the software under the GNU General Public License V3.
Redistributed versions of the software must contain appropriate creadits to the original author of the software.

# How to use
1. Read Known issues and Important
2. Paste the song you want to play in the text box
3. Make sure the song is in an appropriate format and does not contain special characters not recognised by the software
4. Make sure your in-game character is sitting by an instrument 
5. Click play or use the assigned hotkey
6. If the game window does not become the active window on its own, make it so now

An example of a working input is as such:

A B C ABC [ABC] {ABC}

An example of invalid input is as such:

(x2) (x3) etc.

as described in Known issues.

# Planned features

* Faster reuse of notes through "music pieces".
* Ability to use x2 or something similair to play a certain series of notes multiple times without copying and pasting them over and over again.
* Some sooper secret features I am not ready to talk about yet ;)

# Known issues
These issues may lead to the software crashing or the in game character leaving the instrument (See "Important").

* Does not support (x2) etc. tags. The workaround is to paste it for each iteration.

# Important

# Please see this reply regarding the use of macros in Tower Unite: http://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/piano-player/10070/46?u=matias

* The software will send keypresses to the game until it completes the sequence or the stop button, or assigned hotkey, is pressed.
This means that if you leave the instrument prematurely it WILL continue to send keypresses!

Use the software at your own risk.
